# Flutter Sense Hat Environment Variables

Make the Sense Hat Temperature, Humidity and Pressure available vie Bluetooth, and display it in a Flutter app on a phone.

See Bluetooth.md for the Bluetooth GATT UUIDs currently implemented.

The Raspberry Pi Bluetooth server is forked from https://github.com/Douglas6/cputemp, and largely unmodified.
