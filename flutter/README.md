# Bluetooth Sense hat

View Sense Hat environment sensors via Bluetooth

## Getting Started

This is a project to learn how Bluetooth works, and how to program a Flutter central/client to use it, and secondarily, how to program a peripheral/server.

## Required

This project resuires a Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth.  A Pi 3 or 4 has this natively.  Earlier models may work with a USB Bluetooth adapter, but I haven't tested it.

## TODO

See the GitHub issues.
